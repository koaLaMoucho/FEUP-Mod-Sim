### Topic 

The field of this project is Modelation and Simulation of Transportation Systems, addressing the management and optimization of urban parking.

Urban parking, or any other high demand parking area, is a modern problem that affects nearly every city in the world, mostly on developed countries. Lack of parking spaces, innefficient parking management and systems and absurd high demand are just some of the problems caused. By modeling the drivers as agents of the system, and the parking spaces as the resources to be managed, the simulation will allow us to test different strategies and solutions to optimize the urban parking system. 

The project will focus on the parking lot allocation strategies in urban areas. The point is to evaluate the possible different approaches, such as first-come-first-serve, pre-booking, auctions, dynamic pricing, etc, to improve the efficiency indicators of the parking system, such as occupancy, waiting times, revenue and fairness.

### Problem Formulation

From the point of view of Modelation and Simulation, the problem is how to efficiently distribute parking spaces to drivers in urban areas.

The simulation problem can be defined in the following way:

- **Objective:** To modelate and analyze the dynamics of the interaction between drivers and parking spaces in urban areas, under different allocation strategies. The goal is to assess how these strategies impact key performance indicators (KPIs), such as #TODO.

- **What is to be simulated:** 
  - The arrival time of different type of vehicles and *stochastic* parking durations.
  -  The search and allocation process within the parking lot, which includes the internal circulation and gate queues.
  - The impact of different strategies.

- **Purpose:**
    - To predict the parking system's behavior under various strategies and conditions.
    - To compare these strategies **quantitatively** based on KPIs.


### Objectives

The principal objectives of this project are defined below:

- Analyze the system dynamics: To understand how urban parking systems behave under different amounts of demand, 
- Evaluate different allocation strategies:
